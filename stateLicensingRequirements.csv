I was curious if you accept out of state licensed massage therapists to practice massage therapy as a visitor in your state of Arkansas? Arizona does https://massagetherapy.az.gov/node/384 and wanted to know if you had similar requirements for visitors. But if not, I was navigating the home page of your state for massage therapy, and didn't find any information about the cost of a license, application requirements, estimated time to get a license, how many hours of massage education and if it is specifically distributed out to meet a certain number of hours such as 500 total hours with 125 being anatomy, physiology, kinesiology, and pathology and 375 being massage modality, assessment, and application. Also if you have a license reciprocity for having taken a national exam like MBLEX, if you require MBLEX to license, a background check from your department or out of state if recent. And also how long the license lasts, the renewal cost, and continuing education units if you require them?

Massage Therapy Licensure in Arkansas
In order to be licensed as a massage therapist in Arkansas, an individual must meet state-specific educational requirements and pass a series of examinations. Arkansas also mandates background and health screenings.

There are multiple levels of credentialing. After accruing work experience and completing additional continuing education, a massage therapist can apply for a license upgrade.

Arkansas Massage Therapists are currently licensed by the State Board of Health and the Arkansas Department of Health. In 2015, there is a bill in the legislature that would transfer massage therapy regulation to the State Board of Health and the Department of Health.

Update: On April 6, 2015 Governor Asa Hutchinson signed into law Act 1020 of 2015. Act 1020 abolishes the Arkansas State Board of Massage Therapy. All powers are transfered to the State Board of Health and the Arkansas Department of Health. The Act also established the Massage Therapy Technical Advisory Committee.

Massage Therapist Educational Requirements
Sections 6 and 18 of Act 1020 establish the curriculum for postsecondary schools.

The foundation for a massage therapy career is a high school diploma or GED.

The prospective therapist must also complete a massage therapy program of at least 500 hours; education must be pursued through a State-approved or Board-accepted school.

Schools operating within Arkansas are subject to state regulation; they are inspected annually. The Board has provided a list of Arkansas-approved schools (healthy.arkansas.gov/programs services/massage schools examinations)

Individuals educated out-of-state will need to provide evidence of having met Arkansas curricular standards. Arkansas mandates 175 hours of education in anatomy, physiology, pathology, and contraindications and 225 hours of education in massage therapy technique. Additionally, a student must have 25 hours in each of the following:

Hygiene and infection control
Hydrotherapy, heliotherapy, and electrotherapy
Law, professional ethics, and business management, as they relate to massage therapy practice
The remaining 25 hours are to be in other related subjects as approved by the Board.

Examination Requirements
Arkansas professionals can expect to take two examinations en route to licensure: a content examination and a jurisprudence examination. According to state regulation, the Board may administer its own examination or may accept the Federation of State Massage Therapy Board Massage and Bodywork Licensing Exam (MBLEx) in combination with a state-specific test of laws and rules; currently the Board is doing the latter.

The application form references two additional options for content examination: the National Certification Examination for Therapeutic Massage (NCETM) and the National Certification Examination for Therapeutic Massage & Bodywork (NCETMB) Exams. These examinations were offered by the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage & Bodywork (NCBTMB) until February of 2015; the NCBTMB now offers the NCBTMB Board Certification Examination as one part of a rigorous Board Certification process (ncbtmb.com/board certification). The current application pre-dates the transition. Individuals may contact the NCBTMB about score reports and/ or certification. The NCTBM can be reached at 800-296-0664 or ‘info at ncbtmb.org’.

Candidates seeking to take the MBLEx for state licensure can typically be approved for examination within five business days of application. They will receive examination scheduling information at that stage. Examinations are scheduled through Pearson VUE at sites throughout the nation. Applications are available on the website of the Federation of State Massage Therapy Boards (www.fsmtb.org/). Candidates must read the candidate bulletin before submitting their registration. They should be prepared to remit $195. The FSMTB has provided a MBLEx-specific telephone number: 866-962-3926. Candidates also have the option of emailing ‘mblex at fsmtb.org’.

The Arkansas Law Exam may be taken at the Board Office in Little Rock. The application lists current availability as Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays between 9:00 and 3:00. Prospective massage therapists should call the Board to schedule.

Candidates will take the qualifying massage therapy examination prior to application. They may take the state law examination afterward. The fee for the law examination is included among the fees that are paid at the time of application; retakes will incur an additional $25 fee.

Background Check and Medical Requirements
Arkansas requires criminal background checks carried out by the Identification Bureau of the Department of Arkansas State Police.

Applicants must also be checked for tuberculosis and found negative.

The Application Process
Application forms are available for download from the Board website (healthy.arkansas.gov/massage therapy). The application includes detailed instructions.

The Arkansas Board will require evidence of qualifying education. The applicant should include the massage therapy transcript and diploma as well as one of the following: high school or college transcript or diploma, GED.

Out-of-state candidates must provide transcripts with detailed course description.

The licensing agency will also need to see social security card and photo ID.

TB test results may be provided on letterhead or through a clinic form or health card.

Applicants who answer “yes” to criminal history or other background questions will need to attach details.

Applicants who hold, or have held, licensing in another jurisdiction will need to provide license verification. The form inquires about the state’s licensing regulations as well as the current status of the applicant’s credential. Verification forms are available for download from the Board website.

The total fee is $180. This includes a $75 application fee, $80 license fee, and $25 law examination fee. The Board does not accept personal checks.

Master Massage Therapists
An Arkansas massage therapist may receive the designation “Master Massage Therapist” after two years of licensure and practice. The massage therapist will need to have accrued at least 250 hours of practical experience and completed at least 125 hours of continuing education.

Information on How to Apply for a License in DELPROS
Applications are processed in DELPROS (Delaware Professional Regulation Online Services). The online license application process is simple and provides you with clear instructions throughout each stage of the application process. We strongly recommend that you understand what the requirements are for the license you are pursuing. Then, request and gather the documents you need before you begin the application process. Most of the information and forms are on this website. For further clarification of requirements, refer to your profession?s License Law and the Rules and Regulations.

In order to apply for a license or service request, you must have a DELPROS account. To create a new account or log into an existing DELPROS account, follow the instructions at the beginning of the application process. As part of the final steps of the application process, DELPROS instructs you to either ?attach? or ?upload? the required documents directly to your application and/or to ?acknowledge? that you will either send them in yourself or make arrangements for ?third-party? documents/forms to be sent to the Board office. Examples of ?third-party forms? are transcripts from schools, employment verifications from a supervisor, and license verifications from another state. These forms usually require a signature, seal, or notary, therefore, must be mailed into the Board office directly. All documents received by mail are scanned and attached to the appropriate license records.

In DELPROS, you have the ability to save your application and return to it to edit/update information or upload documents for up to six months. However, if you do not submit your application within six months, you will have to restart your online application process. The Board office begins processing applications shortly after submission in the portal. You may check the status of your application in the DELPROS system throughout the whole process and we will correspond with you by email. The requirements for this license type are provided in the following section(s).


Requirements
In addition to submitting the application and fee in DELPROS, you must submit:

An official transcript sent directly from your massage school or approved program to the Board office.  The transcript must show contact information for the school or program director. See Section 4.0 of the Board?s Rules and Regulations.
The transcript must show that you have completed 500 hours of supervised in-class study as a student in a school which trains massage or bodywork therapists, or as a student in an approved program of massage or bodywork therapy. The school or program of training must include a curriculum of no less than:
100 hours of anatomy and physiology
300 hours of technique and theory of massage or bodywork therapy
75 hours of elective courses in the field of massage therapy
25 hours of ethics, law and contraindications.
Proof that the State has approved the school or program.
An example of the proof required is a copy of the certificate of approval issued by the State. You may obtain the certificate from either your school or the State agency responsible for approving the school/program.
The approval must cover the period during which you attended the school/program.
A copy of the school or program catalog.
State of Delaware and Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal background checks (CBC). Follow the instructions on the Criminal History Record Check Authorization form to arrange to be fingerprinted. Submit the forms and payment to the State Bureau of Identification (SBI). Do not send these forms to the Board office.
Allow at least four weeks for the SBI to send criminal history records to the Board office.
A new criminal background check is required even if the person recently had a criminal background check done for some other reason.
An official exam score report to be sent directly from either the Federation of State Massage Therapy Boards (FSMTB) or the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (NCBTMB) to the Board office.
A score report received from you, rather than directly from FSMTB or NCBTMB, is unofficial. If you submit an unofficial copy of the score report, the Board office will not issue a license until it receives the official score report from FSMTB or NCBTMB.
To request NCBTMB exam scores, login to your Career Management System profile on www.ncbtmb.org. The Score Report Request form is available on your profile.
For information on FSMTB?s MBLEx exam, see www.fsmtb.org.
A copy of your current CPR certification card (front and back). Online CPR courses are NOT accepted.

Massage Therapist Educational Requirements
A prospective massage therapist must complete a recognized 500 hour program. In-state programs are subject to state mandates (rules.sos.state.ga.us/cgi bin page.cgi). Each must have a school provider code from the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork and an unencumbered authorization code from the Nonpublic Postsecondary Education Commission (NPEC).

Georgia programs include at least 440 hours of instruction, excluding supervised clinical practice. A 500 hour program will have 50 to 60 hours of supervised clinical experience; a longer program could include much more. The 500 hours are to be divided in the following manner:

Anatomy, physiology, and kinesiology are together to comprise at least 125 hours.

Theory, technique, and practice are to comprise at least 200 hours. This content-area is to include specific Board-mandated techniques, including effleurage, petrissage, compression, superficial warming techniques, direct pressure, and stretching.

Pathology is to comprise 40 hours. Ethics and business management are together to comprise at least ten; of these, at least six should be ethics.

The remaining 125 hours are to address other topics identified by the Board, including benefits and contraindications, client data collection and documentation, therapeutic relationships, and universal precautions.

Curriculum is described in detail in 345-8-.01 of state rules and regulations (rules.sos.state.ga.us/pdf).

The Board has provided a list of programs that are recognized within Georgia (sos.ga.gov/PLB/Reference Recognized Educational Programs in Georgia.pdf).

Out-of-state programs must meet standards that are, at the minimum, substantially equivalent to those of Georgia programs (sos.ga.gov/index.php/licensing faq). The licensing agency has cautioned that not all programs will be accepted.

Examination Requirements
Candidates must pass licensing examinations. Georgia has approved multiple examinations developed by the Federation of State Massage Therapy Boards (FSMTB) and the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (NCBTMB). However, some of the approved examinations are no longer offered.

The Massage and Bodywork Licensing Examination (MBLEx) is currently available and in widespread usage. It was developed by the FSMTB to assess entry-level professional skills. A candidate bulletin is available on the FSMTB website (https://fsmtb.org/). A candidate must read the information before registering. Registration may be submitted online. Once approved, the candidate will contact Pearson VUE about scheduling an examination. Examinations are delivered via computer on an ongoing basis at testing sites around the nation.

Three examinations that were offered by the NCBTMB in the recent past are also referenced in application materials.

National Certification Exam for Therapeutic Massage (NCETM)
National Certification Exam for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (NCETMB)
National Examination for State Licensure (NESL)
The NCETM and NCETMB were offered until February of 2015, at which point the NCBTMB transitioned fully to a new certification examination. The examination is not designed to assess entry-level skills for licensure but instead to be one component of a Board Certification process.

Georgia massage therapy rules state that the Board has the authority to accept other examinations deemed equivalent (rules.sos.state.ga.us pdf).

Out-of-State Massage Therapists
Out-of-state licensees may be endorsed into Georgia if the state has similar or higher standards. Any massage therapist who was ?grandfathered? into licensure in the other state, however, will be required to meet Georgia requirements.

Massage therapists will need to provide official verification from state(s) of licensure. The Board cannot accept a copy of the license in lieu of a verification form.

Out-of-state licensees may be issued provisional permits; the permit holder will need to work under supervision until full licensure is granted (rules.sos.state.ga.us/out of state .pdf).

International Massage Therapist Applicants
Internationally educated massage therapists are to have credential evaluations performed by International Consultants of Delaware, Inc. (ICD). The evaluation must include a certified English translation of the transcript (sos.ga.gov/index.php/licensing faq). Individuals needing credential evaluation can contact ICD at (215) 222-8454.

Criminal Background Check
Georgia requires fingerprint-based criminal background checks, to be carried out by the Georgia Crime Information Center and the FBI. The official vendor is Cogent Systems. Candidates will begin the process by registering with Cogent; this can be done online (ga.cogentid.com/index.htm). Currently, the fingerprinting process must be carried out in Georgia. Individuals can click on their region of the state to find fingerprinting locations (ga.cogentid.com/GA Regions Main).

Background check results are typically available within 48 hours of fingerprinting (ga.cogentid.com/GA Intro GAPS.htm). Applicants will find ORI number and detailed instructions in the forms section of the Board website.

The Application Process
Application forms may be downloaded from the Board website (sos.ga.gov/cgi-bin/board). The applicant will note on the application whether he or she has passed one of the approved examinations or is a new graduate who plans to test. The Board will require official examination results.

The applicant is to present one transcript demonstrating completion of a program; it may include transfer credit from other schools. The official transcript may be included in a sealed envelope or sent directly to the Board by the issuing institution. The Board cannot accept a diploma or certificate in place of the required transcript.

Applicants will need to verify citizenship or lawful presence. The application form must be notarized.

The application is to be accompanied by a $125 fee. This is nonrefundable. Individuals are asked to read Board rules and relevant state law prior to application.

Applicants should allow up to 25 business days for processing of standard applications. If the Board requires additional information, the timeline may be extended.

Application status can be monitored online. New licensees can also go online to confirm status and print a copy of the credential.

Additional Information
The Georgia Board of Massage Therapy (sos.ga.gov/plb massage) can be reached at (478) 207-2440.

Illinois massage therapists must have preliminary education at at least the high school level; a GED is acceptable. The student must complete at least 600 hours of massage therapy education; this represents an increase over years past. An individual who completed a program of fewer than 600 hours may need to complete additional coursework prior to licensure.

Programs are to include coursework in three content areas. The first content area includes anatomy and physiology, pathology, and kinesiology. The second includes massage theory, techniques, and practice. The third is comprised of other content identified by the Board, including benefits and contraindications, history, professional standards, universal precautions, body mechanics, legalities and business, client data collection, documentation, and therapeutic relations and communications. Students are expected to earn grades of at least 70% in their massage therapy coursework.

Illinois programs must meet standards delineated in Section 1284.20 of Title 68 (www.ilga.gov admin code). Out-of-state programs are to have similar standards. They must be authorized by the appropriate agency in their own state.

An individual who is unable to provide sufficient documentation that Illinois standards have been met may be asked to appear before the Board.

Massage Therapist Examination Requirement
The prospective massage therapist will need to pass an approved examination. Multiple examinations may be accepted. State rules reference examinations offered by the Federation of State Massage Therapy Boards (FSMTB) and the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage & Bodywork (NCBTMB).

The examination in current use nationwide as a licensing examination is the FSMTB?s Massage & Bodywork Licensing Examination (MBLEx). It is offered in multiple choice format in English and Spanish. Prospective massage therapists may mail their registration or submit it online (fsmtb.org/mblex application requirements). They will need to pay $195. Once approved, they will schedule through Pearson VUE. Examinations are offered on an ongoing basis. Examination results are provided free of charge to one state licensing agency; this generally happens very soon after testing. The FSMTB has provided a candidate bulletin that must be read prior to application.

The NCBTMB offers a Board Certification examination. It is not intended to be taken for licensing purposes but rather as part of a rigorous supplemental certification process. A Board Certification candidate will need to meet additional requirements imposed by the NCBTMB (ncbtmb.com board certification). The NCBTMB has set educational requirements somewhat higher than the Illinois Board, and certification will not actually be awarded until the massage therapist has accrued 250 practice hours at the professional (or licensed) level.

The NCBTMB has offered other certification examinations in the past. Customer service can be reached by telephone at 1-800-296-0664 or by email at ?info at ncbtmb.org?.

Background Check Requirements
Illinois requires fingerprint-based criminal background checks. Fingerprints are to be made prior to application, but within 60 days.

In-state applicants are to have their fingerprints made electronically through a licensed vendor. The Department of Financial & Professional Regulation has provided a list (www.idfpr.com License Look Up fingerprintlist).

Out-of-state applicants may have their fingerprints made on traditional cards. The out-of-state applicant is directed to call 800-560-6420 or send an email to the Department to request an Illinois State Police fingerprint card. Fingerprints can be made by a police department located in the applicant?s state of residence. The applicant will then mail the card to the Illinois Police Department. The applicant will include a certifying statement that he or she has completed this step; the required form is included in the application packet.

The Application Process
Application materials are available from the Illinois Department of Financial & Professional Regulation (www.idfpr.com Massage Therapy).

Application packets include certification of education forms; these are to be filled out by a school official. The purpose is to document that Illinois coursework requirements were met. In some cases, transcripts may be accepted in lieu of the form. However, the Massage Therapy Board will request additional information if insufficient detail has been provided.

Each application must be accompanied by a $175 fee; fees are nonrefundable.

The Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation may issue a license or pass the application on to the Massage Therapy Board to determine eligibility.

Out-of-State Massage Therapists
Massage therapists who hold, or have held, licensing in other states are required to submit ?Certification by Licensing Agency/Board? forms or other equivalent documentation that may be provided by the out-of-state agency. The applicant will need to submit forms from both the original and current state of licensure, if different.

Out-of-state massage therapists may be licensed by endorsement or by acceptance of examination. In either case, they will need to provide evidence that they have met requirements at the level Illinois requires.

Documents that are in a language other than English must be accompanied by certified translation.

Rule Variances
The Board may consider granting variances in cases where no statute would be violated (ilga.gov/commission jcar admin code).

Additional Information
Massage therapy licensing information is available from the Illinois Department of Financial & Professional Regulation (www.idfpr.com profs Massage Therapy). Applicants with questions may call 1-800-560-6420.

The American Massage Therapy Association-Illinois Chapter is not directly involved with the licensing process but serves as an additional professional resource (http://www.amta-il.org/). AMTA-Illinois has provided answers to frequently asked questions about the licensing process (http://www.amta-il.org/licensing faq).

Louisiana Application for License

 First step of the process:

The following items must be submitted to apply for licensure approval in the State of Louisiana.  Upon approval from LBMT, you must complete the Professional License Registration form and remit payment online or manually by mail.

1. Application – Must be completed, typed or printed legible, submitted with the signed and notarized Verifying Affidavit, which affidavit must be dated within 30 days of the date the application is received by the LBMT Office. For example, if the application is dated April 15th and it is received at the office after May 15th, it is more than 30 days old and a new application would be required.

2. Application fee of $75.00 – Cashier’s Check or Money Order only payable to LBMT. This initial fee covers only the processing of the application. Once the application has been approved, the applicant will be notified of eligibility to be licensed and must then submit a “Professional License Registration” form and pay the original massage therapist license fee.

3. Background Check – Certain types of criminal convictions may disqualify an individual for licensure in Louisiana.  The applicant must submit a criminal background history as part of the application. The criminal background history must cover a period of at least five years preceding the date of the application and must be obtained from a state police agency such as the Louisiana Bureau of Criminal Identification and Information of the Office of State Police within the Department of Public Safety and Corrections (“Bureau”) and/or the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the United States Department of Justice (“FBI”) or an FBI–Approved Channeler as listed on the FBI website. 

     a). Louisiana Residents – Living in Louisiana for 5 years or more
    An applicant who has resided in Louisiana for 5 years or more, may obtain a certified criminal background history from the Louisiana Bureau of Criminal Identification and Information of the Office of State Police within the Department of Public Safety and Corrections (“Bureau”) and/or the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the United States Department of Justice (“FBI”) or an FBI–Approved Channeler as listed on the FBI website. The background report must be certified by the issuing agency and dated within six months of the application submission date.

      b). Louisiana Residents for less than 5 years and Out-of-State Residents
     An applicant, who has resided in Louisiana for any period of less than 5 years, must submit a certified criminal history record from Louisiana as well as a criminal history from any other state or states in which the applicant has resided within the past five years.  The criminal history must cover a five year period and must be obtained from a recognized state police agency for a particular state or the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the United States Department of Justice (“FBI”) or an FBI–Approved Channeler as listed on the FBI website.  As an alternative to obtaining and submitting records from multiple states, a single criminal history record obtained from the FBI or an FBI-Approved Channeler may be submitted.  The background report must be certified by the issuing agency and dated within six months of the application submission date.

    c). Time Requirements
    The background history must be dated within six months of the date the application is submitted to the Louisiana board and must cover at least the preceding five-year period of time.

Questions concerning obtaining a criminal background history record may be directed to the Bureau at 225/925-6006 (Louisiana) and to the FBI at 304/625-2000. You may also use an FBI–Approved Channeler as listed on the FBI website (www.fbi.gov).

4. Official Education Transcript – An applicant must submit an original, certified transcript showing the completion of the educational hours required by Louisiana Law (Title 46 Part XLIV. Chapter 11, §1101 [B]).  The minimum 500 in-class hours shall consist of 325 hours dedicated to the study of massage therapy techniques and clinical practicum-related modalities, 125 hours dedicated to the study of anatomy and physiology, and 50 hours of discretionary related course work, including but not limited to hydrotherapy, business practices and professional ethics, health and hygiene, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and first aid.  To verify this requirement, a course catalog, course syllabus or course description from the school may be requested.

    If the applicant is submitting an educational transcript from any Louisiana or out of state school which does not allow a determination of “in-class” or clock hours, the school must submit information necessary to convert credit hours shown on the transcript into “class hours” to verify that the applicant has met the educational requirements of 500 in-class hours. It is the applicant’s responsibility to obtain the necessary information to verify compliance with the educational requirements.

    In order to satisfactorily complete course requirements to be eligible for licensure, massage school students must have graduated from the school with passing grades and must have attended at least 90 percent of class hours in each subject matter offered in the supervised course of instruction, as reflected by attendance records taken at the beginning of each class meeting. To verify this requirement, attendance records may be requested.

5. Results of National Exam – Applicant must present proof of passing a National Exam and/or MBLEx no more than two years before the date the license application is filed. (Title 46 Part XLIV. Chapter 13, §1301). Proof of passing the exam must be received directly from the examination agency. 

6. Current Photo – Enclose one (1) 2” x 2” color photo of yourself on photo paper.  For example, passport size photo.

7. Reciprocity – If you have a current massage therapy license from another state which has been active for more than one year, you may be eligible for a Louisiana license through reciprocity. If seeking licensure in Louisiana through reciprocity, the education requirements of item 4 and National Exam requirements of Item 5 above are modified. Compliance with items 1, 2, 3 and 6 are required and in addition the following information must be provided:

A completed license verification from each state in which you have been issued a license. The applicant should contact each state board office to request the verification(s) of current or prior licensure be sent directly to LBMT, 2645 O'Neal Lane, bldg. C, Ste. E, Baton Rouge, LA  70816.
Documentation of passing a National Exam and/or MBLEx must be provided directly from the testing agency. Details relating to the exam (item #8, page 4), must be completed.
Official, original and certified transcript showing compliance with the educational requirements of the licensing state.

8. Military or Military Spouse – Please check below if you are in the military or the spouse of a military service member. Enclose a copy of your current Military ID card or a DD Form 214.

This information is included at the beginning of form LBMT001 - Louisiana Application for License available below.

APPLICANT’S LAST NAME: SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER: XXX-XXWHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE JURISPRUDENCE EXAMINATION?
MASSAGE THERAPY – POST EXAM PROCEDURES
Please adhere to the following:
DO NOT call the Board for your MD JP Exam Scores. The exams are scored as quickly as possible within 5 – 7 days
depending on the number of candidates seated for the exam.
Candidates are notified within 10 – 15 days or earlier in writing by chronological order of the date by which the Board
received the completed application (note below).
If you have not received written notification via email (if you provided an email on your application or exam disclosure
forms) or by USPS mail (if you do not have an email); then the conclusion that can be drawn is that you may still have an
incomplete application because either:
? You did not request the Official Documents be sent directly to this Board or your Official Documents have not
been received by the Board as yet. Such Official documents are: the (Massage Therapy Transcript, FSMTB Score
Report, NCBTMB Score Report or College Transcript(s) if you qualify for LMT status OR your Criminal History
Records Check (CHRC) result has not been received). For CHRC please contact CJIS then the Board’s Investigator.
STEPS TO MOVE THE PROCESS FORWARD:
First: Contact your massage training school to ensure that your Official Transcript showing that
you have COMPLETED AND GRADUATED FROM THE MASSAGE THERAPY PROGRAM has be sent
directly to the Board as outlined in the Application AND inquire as to when the school sent it out.
Second: Contact your Testing Agency to ensure that your Official Score Report has been sent directly
to this Board AND inquire when the agency sent it out.
Note: You may contact the Board after 5 business days if you have new or updated information
regarding the status of your Official Documents or changes in address or email address.
Third: Be on the lookout for an email with an attachment or USPS mail for the Exam Pass/Fail
letter along with the Board Data Sheet which will be enclosed for you to complete with your legal name
and information and remit back with the $200 license or registration fee for the actual printing of your
license or registration. It will need to be remitted back to this Board by MAIL.
Generally the entire process after exam passing notification takes less than 14 business days; predicated
on when the applicants submits back the complete datasheet with the license/registration fee.
Please be advised; if you choose to get your license or registration now without the benefit of full 2 years; there is
no proration of fees, refunds, or waivers. The expiration date on the license or registration is the expiration of that
document and if your original license or registration date falls close to a biennial renewal; then you are
responsible to renew.

? All applicants shall successfully take and pass the Board Jurisprudence Examination to qualify
for licensure or registration.
? All applicants must appear for the examination at the time/date specified. Applicants who fail
to appear without prior notification must wait at least thirty (30) days from the date of the
unexcused absence to retest AND must pay a retest fee of $200. There are no refunds for
unexcused absences. (One reschedule will be accepted with at least 24 Hour prior

? If an applicant passes the examination the applicant’s file will be submitted for further processing.
? An applicant failing the examination the first time may retest at the next available examination
date.
? An applicant failing the examination a second time may retest again only after waiting at least (60)
days from the date of the second failure.
? An applicant failing the examination a third time may retest only after waiting at least ninety
(90) days from the date of the third failure, meeting with the Board at its request, and
recommended approval of the Board. Final approval regarding retesting availability will be made
by the Board upon written request of the applicant.
? An applicant’s file shall be closed/terminated one (1) year from the original application date
regardless of the status of the applicant in the exam process. At such occurrence, the applicant
may reapply for qualification and submit all required fees, documentation, and form as a new
applicant. Any/all previous failures will be applied to the new application. For example, an
applicant failing the exam three (3) times under the first application and then reapplying after
lapse of one year, will still have three (3) failures credited to the application and would have to
obtain approval of the Board to retest.

Massage Therapy School
Massage Therapy Licensure in Massachusetts
Massachusetts massage therapists are under the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts Board of Registration of Massage Therapy. They are licensed on the basis of education; examination is not required.

In addition to meeting Massachusetts educational standards, prospective massage therapist must demonstrate good character. A massage therapist must be at least eighteen of age and possess a liability insurance policy as well as a high school or equivalency diploma.

Contacts for the Board and Professional Associations
Massage Therapist Education Requirements
The prospective massage therapist must complete an approved program. The Board does not maintain a list of approved programs, but notes that the school must be licensed in its own jurisdiction. It must also cover a Board-mandated curriculum.

The program must include at least 550 hours of academic coursework and 100 hours of internship or unpaid supervised practice. The Board has identified five academic content areas and set a minimum number of hours of study in each one. Additionally, the Board has published a detailed set of curricular guidelines, outlining concepts that should be addressed (mass.gov / licensee dpl boards mt).

The program is expected to cover the following content:

Anatomy and physiology coursework is to comprise at least 100 hours. It is to cover structure and function of ten body systems, including the cardiovascular system, endocrine system, nervous system, and digestive system.

Pathology coursework is to comprise at least 45 hours. It is to cover the pathologies that a massage therapist typically encounters; contraindications and precautions are to receive coverage.

Kinesiology coursework is to comprise another 45 hours. The student will learn to identify and palpate muscular attachments and bellies.

Massage therapy theory and technique is to comprise fully 300 hours. This content area includes many skills, from the actual musculoskeletal palpation to treatment planning, draping, and writing of treatment notes. The student will also identify and develop personal care skills such as biomechanics. The Board notes that coursework in techniques that do not fall under the Board's definition of massage cannot be credited. Examples would be reiki, acupressure, and reflexology (mass.gov/ocabr / regulations / advisory ruling regarding the 300 hours).

Ethics and professionalism is to comprise at least 60 hours. This coursework will cover concepts such as professional boundaries, legal requirements, ethics codes, and confidentiality. The student will also develop job search and marketing skills and learn about opportunities for continued growth and professional development.

The prospective massage therapist must complete 100 hours of unpaid internship. At least 60 hours must be hands-on practice. The board will credit up to 100 hands-on clinical hours.

The Board notes that out-of-state transcripts can be reviewed if the school is either approved by the massage therapy regulatory agency or appropriately licensed (mass.gov/ocabr board policies regarding school transcripts).

Other Requirements: Liability Insurance
The prospective massage therapist will need to take out a liability insurance policy with coverage of at least $1,000,000; this figure is both the aggregate and ""per occurrence"" minimum.

State statute lists among the requirements not having been convicted, during the prior ten years, of a crime that is sexually-related or involves “moral turpitude” (malegislature.gov Session Laws Chapter135).

Statute also specifies “good moral character” This determination is left to Board discretion.>

The Application Process
Application materials can be downloaded from the Board website (mass.gov ocabr licensee forms). Applicants are asked to read the licensing regulations before submitting their qualifications. Regulations are also available online (mass.gov ocabr licensee regulations).

Official transcripts are to be included in their original sealed envelopes. The Board also requests syllabi or course descriptions. The applicant will fill out a transcript analysis form to document coursework in specific Board-mandated areas. He or she will list applicable courses under each content area. If only a portion of a course addressed a particular content area, the applicant will list only those hours that did.

The applicant will need to provide two reference letters. One is to come from someone who he or she has had a professional relationship with; the professional might be a massage therapist, massage therapist instructor, or healthcare provider. The other is to come from someone who is not related to the applicant and can address his or her integrity. Reference letters should also be included in the application package in their original sealed envelopes.

The applicant is to furnish a copy of the declarations page from his or her insurance policy.

Massachusetts requires verification of all professional licenses, whether in massage therapy or other professions. If the license was granted by the Massachusetts Division of Professional Licensure, it will not be necessary to include a certificate of standing.

If a particular document will arrive after other application materials, the applicant should include a note to this effect (mass.gov ocabr frequently asked questions on massage therapy).

A two by two photograph is to be attached to the application.

The applicant will need to pay a $225 fee; it cannot be refunded even in cases where licensure is denied.

The application packet includes two forms which require notarization.

The application includes questions about legal and professional history. Applicants will affirmative responses will need to provide details. The Board carries out criminal history checks on applicants; other records may also be checked.

Application materials are to be sent to the Board office in Boston.

In most cases, applicants will not receive confirmation of application receipt. Applicants who want receipt confirmation may send the application package ""return receipt requested"". They also have the option of emailing the Board.

The process typically takes four to six weeks. Applicants can expect email correspondence if there is information missing from their files. The licensing agency will later send license confirmation by email. New licensees can also go online to check status; the license card will not arrive in the mail until approximately a month later.

The licensing process can be expedited for military spouses (mass.gov ocabr oca agencies valor act info). The individual will need to submit a ‘Relocated Military Spouse Affidavit Form’.

Additional Information
Massage therapist licensure is governed by statutes, regulations, and Board policies and guidelines. Prospective massage therapists should be aware that requirements change periodically; educational standards increased in 2010.

Applicants are invited to contact the Board if they have unanswered questions. The Massachusetts Board of Registration of Massage Therapy (mass.gov ocabr dpl boards) can be reached by telephone at (617) 727-3074. Additional contact information is found in the application packet.

The Massachusetts Chapter of the American Massage Therapy Association is not involved with the licensing process but serves as an additional professional resource (massamta.org).

Massage Therapy Licensure in Michigan
Licensure has been mandatory for Michigan massage therapists since November 29, 2014. The grandfathering period, moreover, has ended. Licensees must meet training and examination requirements.

Massage Therapist Education & Training Requirements
Prospective massage therapists must complete programs that include state-approved curriculum.

According to Board Administrative Rule, programs must be at least 500 hours (www7.dleg.state.mi.us / Bureau of Health Care Services). They must include the following coursework:

Instruction in massage/ bodywork theory, technique, and assessment: 200 hours
Instruction in body systems, to include kinesiology, anatomy, and physiology: 125 hours
Instruction in business and practice management: 4 hours
Ethics instruction: 6 hours
Pathology coursework: 40 hours
The remaining hours must be related to the practice of massage therapy. The student will need to spend at least 40 hours providing massage services at a student clinic.

Students may credit online coursework toward the pathology, body systems, and business/ ethics/ professional practice requirements. However, they may not credit online instruction toward the 500 hour minimum required for licensure.

The Michigan Board of Massage Therapy has provided a list of state-approved programs (http://www.michigan.gov / approved Massage Therapy program list pdf). Programs are housed in community colleges as well as technical/ vocational schools. Information may change periodically. Prospective students will find the most current list on the Board website.

Curriculums that are not specifically approved within Michigan should be equivalent.

Massage Therapist License Examination Requirements
The Michigan Board will accept any of several licensing examinations. Some of the adopted examinations, however, have recently been discontinued.

The Massage and Bodywork Licensing Examination (MBLEx), offered by the Federation of State Massage Therapy Board (FSMTB), is the current offering. By agreement between the FSMTB and the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (NCBTMB), the MBLEx is the sole national examination intended to assess entry-level professional skills for the purpose of state licensure. It is available in English and Spanish

Individuals can register and pay the MBLEx examination fee (currently $195) online (fsmtb.org/). They do not need to submit transcripts but must confirm that they have read the information bulletin and have appropriate training. ATTs are issued within a matter of days. Approved candidates schedule their own computerized examinations through Pearson VUE. Applicants who select the Michigan Board of Massage Therapy as their score recipient will have examination results sent electronically, generally within 24 hours of testing.

The Michigan Board also approved the National Certification Examination for Therapeutic Massage (NCETM) and the National Certification Examination for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (NCETMB). However, these examinations are no longer available. The NCBTMB now offers a different examination as part of a rigorous Board Certification process that supplements but does not replace licensure. The NCBTMB can be reached by telephone at 1-800-296-0664 or by email at ‘info at ncbtmb.org’.

Background Check Requirements
Michigan requires applicants to have fingerprint-based criminal background checks. In-state applicants will have their fingerprints captured electronically. They are to use vendors approved by the Michigan State Police (michigan.gov / msp). They are directed to contact the chosen vendor seven to ten days after submitting the application. They will need the agency ID number.

Out-of-state applicants may have their fingerprints made on government-issued fingerprint cards such as the standard FBI (FD-258) card. After the prints are made, they will need to be sent to the approved vendor, Identogo, for processing. There is a $62.75 fee. The applicant is to register and select his or her payment method before mailing the cards; this process can be carried out online. Nonresident instructions are available on the Identogo website (l1enrollment.com / forms mi). Identogo can be reached by telephone at 866-226-2952.

Criminal history is reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The licensing agency takes into account not only the type of conviction but the age that the applicant was and the time that has elapsed since.

The Application Process
Application packets can be downloaded from the website of the Michigan Board of Massage Therapy (michigan.gov / lara).

The application packet includes a section that is be completed by a program director at the massage school. The purpose is to confirm that the graduate has had the minimum number of instruction and training hours in each Board-mandated subject.

Applicants will also need to provide official high school transcripts (or official verification of having earned a GED). A Michigan graduate may have the option of having his or her transcript sent electronically.

Applicants who answer ""yes” to personal data questions regarding criminal history, discipline, or recent substance abuse treatment will need to furnished the licensing agency with detailed explanation, including relevant court documents or other official documentation.

An application for initial licensure should be accompanied by a $95 fee.

Applicants should allow at least two weeks to pass before checking status.

Applications that include the required fee but do not include all documents necessary to establish eligibility may be held open for up to two years.

Out-of-State Applicants
The Michigan licensing agency requires official verification from all states where the applicant has ever held licensing as a massage therapist; the Board notes that it is not sufficient to include a copy of the license.

Out-of-state massage therapists who received their initial licensing less than five years prior must provide evidence of having met Michigan’s educational requirements. Those who have been licensed in another U.S. state for more than five years will not need to meet Michigan curriculum requirements but will need to provide evidence of 1) having graduated from high school or obtained equivalency and 2) having passed an approved examination.

Applicants who hold current licensing in other states will use the endorsement application.

International Applicants
International applicants must have their credentials reviewed by some agency that is accredited by the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services, or NACES (www.naces.org). Those who pursued their massage therapy education in a language other than English will also need to provide scores from either the TOEFLibt or the TOEFL and the TSE.

Candidates who take the TOEFLibt are expected to make the following minimum scores:

Reading: 22
Listening: 22
Speaking: 26
Writing: 24
The Board will also accept written TOEFL scores of 550 (or computerized scores of at least 230) if the TSE score is at least 50.

Additional Information
The Michigan Board of Massage Therapy (michigan.gov / lara) can be reached by telephone at (517) 335-0918 or by email at ‘bhpinfo at michigan.gov’.

The Michigan Chapter of the American Massage Therapy Association is not involved with the licensing process but serves as an additional professional resource (amtamichigan.org/).

Massage Therapist Requirements in Minnesota
Minnesota does not, as of 2015, have a law to license or register massage therapists at the state level. However, this does not mean there are no laws in place. Massage therapists in many municipalities, including St. Paul, Hopkins, and Burnsville do work under licenses. The Alliance for Licensing Massage Therapists, a Minnesota-based organization, reports that massage therapists statewide are required to abide by the Unlicensed Complementary and Alternative Health Care Practices Act, and that the act requires them to provide patients with a bill of rights.

The Alliance is one of the Mississippi organizations that has been working on greater regulation at the state level. Another is the Minnesota Chapter of the American Massage Therapy Association. The latest bill, which would create voluntary statewide registration, did not get heard by the Government Operations Committee during the session ending in 2015 but will start there during the next session.

What can prospective massage therapists do right now, if they live in a jurisdiction that does not license professionals? One is to get an education on a par with nationally recognized standards. Another is to consider third party certification or examination. Yet another: to stay in the know on legislative developments.

Select a Minnesota Massage Therapist Topic:
Massage Therapy Schools in Minnesota
Massage Therapist Education Options
Voluntary Massage Therapist Certification
Staying Current on New Developments in Massage Therapy
Massage Therapy Education
Most states require massage therapists to have at least 500 hours of related education and training, though some set the requirement higher. National organizations, too, tend to set the standard at 500 hours or above. There are often specific curriculum requirements as well.

A student can expect that a program meets widely accepted standards if it has the approval of a nationally recognized organization. The National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork is one such organization. Programs that have been assigned school codes by the NCBTMB meet the organization's basic standards: They are operating legitimately. They offer programs that are at least 500 hours total and meet curricular minimums in NCBTMB-identified content areas.

A search of the NCBTMB's database reveals 20 Minnesota programs with NCBTMB codes (ncbtmb.org / find approved school MN).

The Commission on Massage Therapy Accreditation (COMTA), unlike the NCBTMB, is an accrediting agency. It is recognized as such by the U.S. Department of Education. Minnesota currently boasts two COMTA-accredited massage therapy schools (https://comta.org/member-directory/).

Programs may also be members of the American Massage Therapy Association (AMTA). AMTA member schools have at least 500 in-class hours. There are seven member schools in Minnesota (amtamassage.org / minnesota schools).

Prospective students should be aware that many states require that schools have particular accreditations or approvals. Many will accept either national accreditation or state approval.

Voluntary Certification
National or 'board' certifications are voluntary third party credentials that may be pursued by practitioners in both regulated and unregulated states.

The National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork is the industry standard. The NCBTMB used to offer national certification. National certification did not give massage therapists the legal right to work if they lived in jurisdictions that regulated the profession, but did allow therapists from unregulated states to show that they had met comparable standards. The NCBTMB now offers board certification which represents, in some ways, a higher standard (ncbtmb.org / board certification). Board certified massage therapists have fully 750 hours of education, though the qualifying education does not all have to be completed as part of the original diploma or certificate program. What is important is that the original program meets basic NCBTMB standards and has been assigned a code. Those who did not graduate from NCBTMB-assigned schools may inquire about portfolio review (ncbtmb.com / board certification).

Candidates for board certification must pass an examination. They must also pursue CPR certification and affirm their opposition to human trafficking and their commitment to uphold a professional code of ethics.

An individual who lives in an area where there is no regulation may want to pursue the ABMP Certified Massage Therapist credential through Associated Bodywork and Massage Professionals (abmp.com / practitioners / membership options and costs). The massage therapist will need to document either 500 hours of education or passing scores on the national licensing examination, the MBLEx (fsmtb.org/). In order to maintain membership at the certified level, the massage therapist will need to pursue continuing education during each renewal period.

There are other certifications that represent specialties of massage therapy or other closely related disciplines. The American Medical Massage Association, based in Michigan, offers certification in medical massage (americanmedicalmassage.com/). Again, the educational prerequisites are more stringent than what may be offered in many legitimate massage schools. However, massage therapists who have the basic education may choose to pursue the more specialized education later.

Staying Current on New Developments
Professional associations can help practitioners and future practitioners stay current on developments in the field. One option is the American Massage Therapy Association. The AMTA posts state legislative updates (amtamassage.org / government / leg briefing). A person does not need to be a member to view them. However, membership confers additional benefits. Minnesota has its own state chapter, AMTA-Minnesota (amtamn.org/). AMTA-Minnesota also provides information about government relations.

Massage therapists may also seek membership in Associated Bodywork and Massage Professionals.

It is also advisable to obtain a license from your neighboring state to maintain Rules and Regulations placed for consumer protection, thereby enhancing the awareness and necessity for a Minnesota State Licensing Board. Then when Minnesota does begin a State Board, if you have an Association with your Liability Insurance and have maintained your CEUs you can be grandafathered in very easily with a recorded history to back up your experience.

Massage Therapy Licensure in Mississippi
Mississippi massage therapists are licensed by the State Board of Massage Therapy. They must complete approved massage therapy programs and pass two examinations en route to licensure.

A Mississippi massage therapist must also meet other state-specific requirements like clearing a criminal background check and obtaining current CPR certification.

Massage Therapist Educational Requirements
Mississippi requires a minimum 700 hours of education and training. The student will need at least 600 hours of academic coursework and at least 100 hours of supervised practice in a student clinic.

The instructional hours are to be distributed as follows:

Study of the human body is to comprise at least 200 hours. There must be at least 20 hours devoted to each of the following: anatomy, physiology, neurology, myology/ kinesiology, and pathology; pathology coursework is to include medical terminology. The other 100 hours of body systems study may be distributed among the required content areas in any manner.

Massage therapy theory and practicum are together to comprise at least 200 hours. At least 100 of these hours are to consist of demonstration and supervised practice; demonstration and practice is to include client evaluation, draping, and range-of-motion as well as specific massage techniques identified by the Board, for example, kneading, stroking, percussion, vibration, and use of hand-held tools. At least 20 combined hours are to cover massage therapy history, indications, contraindications and benefits. Also included in this content area are 10 hours of study in legality and ethics; this is to include Mississippi massage therapy law.

Allied modalities are to comprise at least 200 hours. The following content must be included:

Eastern, Western, and European methods: 7 hours
Hydrotherapy and infrared heat: 25 hours
Healthcare referral: 20 hours
Charting and documentation: 10 hours
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation and first aid: 8 hours
The remaining hours may consist of additional coursework in the five content areas above or other massage therapy and wellness topics, for example, special populations, trigger points, safety, and communication.

The 100 hours spent in the student clinic includes instruction and evaluation time as well as time spent carrying out hands-on sessions; the Board expects a one-to-one ratio between the two.

Mississippi programs are required to pursue accreditation through the Commission on Massage Therapy Accreditation or another similar agency; newer programs may not yet hold this accreditation.

Mississippi schools may accept transfer credit. However, acceptance of transfer credit is governed by state regulation. A semester hour may be worth 15 credit hours, if accepted for credit.

Educational standards are described in Rule 4.2 of Board Rules and Regulations (msbmt.state.ms.us / msbmt).

A list of approved programs is available on the Board website (msbmt.state.ms.us / msbmt / web.nsf).

Mississippi now mandates that prospective massage therapists have AIDS/ HIV awareness training. Mississippi-approved programs include this training.

Examination Requirements
Mississippi massage therapists take both a comprehensive examination and a jurisprudence examination.

Of the comprehensive examinations that have been approved by the Board, only one is currently available. It is the Massage and Bodywork Licensing Examination (MBLEx), an offering of the Federation of State Massage Therapy Boards (https://www.fsmtb.org / mblex/). Some students take the examination before graduation. Individuals who need to take the examination will find information on the FSMTB website. They will need to include a $195 fee with their applications. The ATT is issued within five business days. Candidates schedule their examinations at computerized testing centers.

The license application materials reference other approved examinations that massage therapists may have taken in the past. These include the Mississippi State Pre-Licensing Examination (MSPLE) and the National Certification Examination for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (NCETMB). The Board has stated that the National Certification Examination for Therapeutic Massage (NCETM) is not acceptable (msbmt.state.ms.us / LN FAQs EXAMINATION).

The prospective licensee will also need to pass the Mississippi State Law Exam (MSLE) with a score of at least 70%. A candidate will need permission from the Board. If the student is currently attending a Mississippi massage therapy school, permission will be arranged by the school. Students who have already graduated can apply directly (msbmt.state.ms.us/msbmt/web.nsf / Exams). There is a $100 fee.

The MSLE is currently offered one time per month. The Board has published a schedule of upcoming application deadlines and tentative test dates (msbmt.state.ms.us / msbmt / Exams Page).

Other Requirements: First Aid and CPR Certifications
The applicant must hold current first aid and CPR certifications. Certification may be granted by the American Heart Association, American Red Cross, or American Safety and Health Institute.

Mississippi requires background checks carried out by the Mississippi Department of Public Safety and the FBI. Background checks are carried out in conjunction with the Mississippi State Law Exam. Massage therapy graduates pay the $36 background check fee when they register for the jurisprudence examination.

The Application Process
Application forms are posted on the Board website (msbmt.state.ms.us / msbmt / LN Licensure).

The applicant will need two passport-quality photographs; these are to be signed and dated.

The massage therapy transcript is to be sent directly from the school.

AIDS/ HIV awareness training is to be documented on an official transcript.

CPR and first aid certification is documented by certification card.

The application includes an affidavit that requires notarization.

The applicant is to include a $50 application fee and $200 licensure fee.

License by Reciprocity
An out-of-state massage therapist can be licensed by reciprocity with as few as 500 in-class hours of academic instruction, provided he or she has the requisite qualifications, including experience. Reciprocity candidates must have three years of experience; this requirement is the same whether the massage therapist comes from a regulated or unregulated state.

A provisional permit can allow an out-of-state massage therapist to begin practice sooner. There is an additional fee of $30 for the provisional permit.

Licensing of Military-Trained Applicants and Military Spouses

Some reciprocity requirements are different for military-trained applicants and for military spouses who relocate to Mississippi. These candidates will need to demonstrate massage therapy experience for at least two of the previous five years. A minimum program length is not specified. However, the applicant will need to pass examinations required in Mississippi. State code specifies that a military spouse may credit volunteer work.

Additional Information
The Mississippi State Board of Massage Therapy is the source for current information (msbmt.state.ms.us / msbmt). Candidates should be aware that regulations change periodically; the most recent revisions were in 2013. The Board can be reached by telephone at (601) 732-6038 or by email at 'director at msbmt.state.ms.us'.

The Mississippi Chapter of the American Massage Therapy Association is an additional professional resource (amtamassage.org / chapters / 82445).

Massage Therapy Licensure in Missouri
Missouri massage therapists are under the jurisdiction of the Board of Therapeutic Massage. Full licensure is dependent on meeting education and examination requirements.

There are multiple levels of licensure. The lowest level is “student”; this allows a massage therapy student to practice therapeutic massage on the public.

Massage Therapist Educational Requirements
Prospective massage therapists must complete at least 500 hours of studies. A massage therapy program may be school-based. State code also allows students to do their training through a board-approved apprenticeship program (sos.mo.gov / adrules / 20csr pdf).

A massage therapy school may draw its authorization from the Coordinating Board of Higher Education (CBHE), the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE), a comparable agency in another state, or a regional accrediting agency.

No fewer than 300 hours are to be devoted to the theory and practice of massage therapy. At least 100 hours are to be in anatomy and physiology. The curriculum must also include 50 hours in the combined areas of business practice, hygiene, ethics, and Missouri massage law. Another 50 hours are to cover ancillary therapies; CPR training is included in this content strand. A detailed description of educational requirements can be found in CSR 2197-2.010 (sos.mo.gov / adrules pdf). Requirements for mentoring programs are found in CSR 2197-4 (sos.mo.gov / adrules / csr / 20csr 20c2197-4 pdf).

Massage Therapist Examination Requirements
Missouri massage therapists are licensed on the basis of examination. The Board has approved a number of examinations. They include the following:

The Massage and Bodywork Licensing Examination (MBLEx)
The National Certification Examination for Therapeutic Massage (NCETM)
The National Certification Examination for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (NCETBM)
The Asian Bodywork Therapy (ABT) Examination
The American Medical Massage Association National Board Certification Examination (AMMA NBCE) if ""administered as of 2006""
State code allows for acceptance of other examinations that may be deemed appropriate.

The MBLEx is an offering of the Federation of State Massage Therapy Boards, or FSMTB (fsmtb.org/).

The NCETM and NCETMB are former offerings of the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork, or NCBTMB. Both were administered until February 2015. Examinees can contact the NCBTMB by telephone at (800)296-0664 or by email at ‘info at ncbtmb.org’.

The ABT is a former offering of the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine, or NCCAOM (nccaom.org/). Customer service information is accessible from the NCCAOM homepage; the page includes a link for individuals who need score reports sent to licensing agencies. NCCAOM can be reached by telephone at (904) 598-1005.

Information about AMMA examination and certification is available through the American Medical Massage Association (americanmedicalmassage.com / testing).

The Examination Process
An applicant can be issued a provisional license when an examination has been scheduled but not yet taken.

The examination process, however, may be completed relatively quickly. The MBLEx is the current licensing examination that enjoys the most widespread acceptance in the United States. An individual who applies for the MBLEx can be approved to test within a week. An approved candidate is issued an Authorization to Test (ATT) which can be used to schedule at a Pearson VUE computerized testing center. The Federation of State Massage Therapy Boards does not require transcripts. Candidates are asked to confirm that they have read the candidate information bulletin (fsmtb.org / mblex). There is a $195 examination fee.

The FSMTB typically sends the score report to one licensing agency selected by the examinee.

Background Check and Liability Insurance Requirements
Prospective Missouri massage therapists must have fingerprint-based background checks processed by the Missouri State Highway Patrol and the FBI (pr.mo.gov/boards massage fingerprint information pdf). This step should be carried out before application. The agency's approved vendor is Cogent 3M. Applicants begin the process by registering through the Missouri Automated Criminal History Site (MACHS). They may register online (www.machs.mo.gov) or call 877-862-2425. Electronic fingerprinting facilities are located inside the state's UPS stores. There is a $44.80 fee for the background check. The applicant will need to bring a recent photograph to the appointment. Background checks will be received automatically by the licensing agency, but the applicant should save his or her receipt to include in the application package.

Applicants must provide also evidence of liability insurance.

The Application Process
Application forms are found on the website of the Missouri Division of Professional Registration (pr.mo.gov / massage application forms). The stage at which an applicant first applies will vary according to individual circumstances. The ‘forms’ page includes materials for applicants at the student, provisional, and permanent levels.

Transcripts may be submitted at the provisional or permanent level. Transcripts are to be official copies. The licensing agency allows the program or mentor to fill out a section of the application, however, if there is not a transcript available.

An applicant who answers “yes” to background questions will need to provide explanatory information on separate paper.

The application for permanent licensure directs individuals who have held licensing in other states or territories to provide license verification.

An application for permanent licensure is to be accompanied by a $125 fee. The fee is $75 at the provisional level.

Application status can now be monitored online (renew.pr.mo.gov / checklist login).

Additional Information
The Missouri Board of Therapeutic Massage (pr.mo.gov / massage) can be reached by email at ‘massagether at pr.mo.gov’ or by telephone at 573-522-6277.

Massage Therapist Educational Requirements
The prospective massage therapist must complete a program of at least 500 hours. The curriculum is to meet the standards of some agency that holds accreditation through the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (mtrules.org/gateway / RuleNo.asp).

Board administrative rule specifically references standards adopted by the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (mtrules.org / RuleNo 2E155%2E605). The referenced NCBTMB standards mandate 500 total hours, distributed as follows: 125 hours of instruction in body systems (anatomy, physiology, kinesiology); 200 hours of instruction in massage and bodywork theory, application, and assessment; 40 hours in pathology; ten hours in ethics and business (with no fewer than six hours in ethics).

The rule notes that other curriculum guidelines may be reviewed.

Examination Requirements
The candidate will need to pass an examination. Four national examinations have been approved. State examinations can also be accepted if the Board deems them equivalent.

Three of the national examinations referenced in administrative rule are no longer administered. The National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork has ceased to offer the NCETMB, NESL, and NCETM. Instead it offers a Board Certification examination that is not intended to assess entry-level skills; the examination is intended to be taken as part of a rigorous Board Certification process.

The Massage and Bodywork Licensing Examination, or MBLEx, an offering of the Federation of State Massage Therapy Boards, is in widespread use as a licensing examination (www.fsmtb.org/). Candidates can visit the FSMTB website to download candidate bulletins and complete the registration process. They should be prepared to pay a $195 examination fee. Registration is processed within five working days. Approved candidates can schedule at computerized testing sites. The ATT grants a 90-day testing window. A candidate will select the licensing agency that scores should be reported to. (There is no fee to have scores reported to one agency; an examinee who needs additional score reports will pay $20 for each.)

The Application Process
License applications are available on the Board website (bsd.dli.mt.gov/license / lmt board page). There is also an online application system (bsd.dli.mt.gov/license / bsd boards lmt board). Applicants are asked to review the applicable laws and rules before submission.

High school graduation (or equivalency) can be documented through an official certificate of completion or a certified copy of a transcript. The licensing agency will also need evidence that the applicant is at least eighteen; a copy of a driver’s license will suffice.

The applicant must secure two confidential letters, both attesting to good character. The form is found in the application packet. The applicant will fill out the top portion and forward it to the references; they will mail the completed forms back to the licensing agency.

Applicants are required to submit license verification if they hold, or have held, licensing or state registration in a professional discipline.

The combined application/ licensing fee is $140 (mtrules.org/gateway / E401). It cannot be refunded, even in cases where licensure is denied.

Routine application files are typically processed within 30 days of the time of completion. Nonroutine applications may take as long as 120 days.

The Board typically reviews only those applications that are considered nonroutine. An application may be considered nonroutine for any of multiple reasons, including the applicant having a criminal history or having passed an examination other than one that has been approved by the Board (mtrules.org / gateway Rule No E613). Some applicants with very minor criminal history may not require Board review; this is the case when convictions fall into categories that would not preclude licensure.

Out-of-State Massage Therapists
Out-of-state massage therapists can be licensed by credential if it is determined that they hold an equivalent license.

The licensing agency reports that the following states have been reviewed and found eligible for license by credential: Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Utah, and Washington (bsd.dli.mt.gov/license / lmt board). Additional states may be added to the list following review.

Out-of-state licensees will find a “license by credential” application on the Board website (bsd.dli.mt.gov/license / bsd_boards). They should be prepared to provide a copy of the statutes and rules that govern licensure in the other state.

The out-of-state license must be in good standing. A license verification form is included in the application packet. The massage therapist will fill out the top portion and send it to the state of licensure.

Applicants for license by credential will need to provide two character references as well as documentation of age and documentation of high school completion (or equivalency).

If the other state’s statutes and rules to do not establish equivalency, the licensing agency may request additional information from the applicant.

Licensing Process

Massage Therapy School
Massage Therapy Licensure in New Mexico
New Mexico massage therapists are licensed by the New Mexico Massage Therapy Board. The state issues both temporary and permanent massage therapist licenses. Temporary licensure is based on education; permanent licensure, on education and examination. The Massage Therapy Board also issues massage therapy instructor credentials.

Massage therapists must be at least eighteen. High school (or equivalency) is considered the prerequisite level.

Massage Therapist Educational Requirements
First-time massage therapists (those who have not accrued professional experience under license or registration) will need fully 650 hours of massage therapy education and training (nmac/parts/title16/).

The massage therapy student will need at least 165 hours of coursework in anatomy and physiology and other closely related disciplines. At least 40 of the required hours in this content strand are to be in pathology. Kinesiology is also to receive coverage.

At least 150 hours are to consist of massage therapy training; this is to include coverage of contraindications.

At least 75 hours are to be in content areas that the Board terms ""general instruction"". No fewer than 30 of the general instruction hours are to be in professional ethics. Also included in this content area are 1) first aid and 2) CPR/AED; the prospective massage therapist will need four hours in each. Hydrotherapy and business are both to receive coverage.

Electives may be in any of the following: theory, hands-on modalities related to massage therapy, breathing and stretching, nutrition, herbology, homeopathy, and counseling. The student may also credit additional hours of anatomy and physiology or massage therapy. Up to 150 hours of practicum may be credited. Other elective topics may be credited, but will need Board approval.

Up to 150 hours of credit may be awarded for prior professional experience carried out under licensure or registration.

The Board registers massage therapy schools that meet requirements. Out-of-state education can be accepted if the school was appropriately accredited (rld.state.nm.us / boards / Massage Therapy FAQs).

Examination Requirements
***UPDATE***MBLEx will be the sole licensing exam for the Massage Profession, this will facilitate portability and standardization for Massage Therapists.

A New Mexico massage therapist must pass a national massage therapy examination and a state jurisprudence examination.

State rules reference three national examinations: the National Certification Examination for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (NCETMB), the National Certification Examination for Therapeutic Massage (NCETM) and the Massage and Bodywork Licensing Examination (MBLEx).

The NCETMB and NCETM are no longer administered (as of February 2015). The National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (ncbtmb.com/) continues in its role of approving massage therapy programs and awarding credentials to practitioners with high levels of expertise. Massage therapists may contact the NCBTMB for information or to obtain score reports. The NCBTMB can be reached at 800-296-0664 or at ‘info at ncbtmb.com’.

Candidates can register for the MBLEx through the Federation of State Massage Therapy Boards (FSMTB). There is a $195 fee. The applicant is not required to submit transcripts to the FSMTB but must affirm having read the candidate handbook. The examination is multiple choice and is available in both English and Spanish (fsmtb.org / mblex application requirements/). Computer-adapted examinations are scheduled on an ongoing basis through Pearson VUE. Examination results will be transmitted electronically to the New Mexico Board (provided that that is the license agency that the candidate selected at the time of application). Individuals who have already passed the MBLEX can request additional score reports for $20. The MBLEX program can be reached at ‘mblex at fsmtb.org’ or 866-962-3926.

An applicant will receive a copy of the state jurisprudence examination in the mail.

An individual who has never sat for a national examination may be granted a temporary license, valid for up to three months. A temporary license is invalidated if the massage therapist fails the examination.

License by Credentials
Massage therapists may be licensed by credential if they have met similar education and examination requirements in other jurisdictions; the requirements must be judged to be at least substantially equivalent to those of New Mexico (rld.state.nm.us / Massage Therapy Requirements and Continuing Education). Both U.S. and international licenses will be considered when granting license by credentials. Past disciplinary action will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. In some cases, the Board may issue a provisional or conditional license.

The Application Process
Individuals can submit applications when they have met all requirements but examination. License applications may be downloaded from the website of the New Mexico Regulation and Licensing Department (rld.state.nm.us / Massage Therapy Applications). The licensing agency encourages prospective applicants to review the applicable rules.

Some supplemental materials will be required. The applicant will need a two by two head-and-shoulders photograph.

Transcripts are to be sent directly to the licensing agency from the massage school. In unusual circumstances (for example, destruction of records) the Board may consider other evidence.

Out-of-state graduates will need to request that the school complete ‘Form A’, documenting the number of hours in each required content area and subject. In-state students will also need to have Form A submitted if they attended more than one school or if they completed their program more than two years in the past.

Out-of-state licensees can use ‘Form B’ to document license status; the form will need to be filled out by the appropriate agency.

Any documents that are not in English must be accompanied by a translation and an affidavit from the translator; the licensing agency will also need the translator’s contact information.

A massage therapist must pay two fees before permanent licensure is granted. The application fee is $75. The license fee is pro-rated and is assessed when it has been determined that the applicant meets all requirements, with the possible exception of examination (rld.state.nm.us / Massage Therapy Fees).

Massage Therapy Instructor Registration
In order to be registered as a massage therapist instructor, a professional must attain 50 hours of instructional experience. He or she must also provide evidence of having practiced during at least two of the prior three years.

A massage therapist who holds concurrent instructor registration has higher requirements for continuing education.

Additional Information
The New Mexico Massage Therapy Board (rld.state.nm.us / Massage Therapy) can be reached by telephone at 505-476-4870 or by email at ‘massage.board at state.nm.us’.

The New Mexico Chapter of the American Massage Therapy Association (AMTA-NM) is an additional professional resource (http://amta-nm.org). One of the organization’s goals is to keep massage therapists informed of legislative developments (nm.wp.amtamassage.org/).

Definition of Practice | General Requirements | Fees | Partial Refunds | Education Requirements | Examination Requirement | Applicants Licensed in Another Jurisdiction (Endorsement) | Limited Permits

Definition of Practice of Massage Therapy - Education Law, Section 7801
The practice of the profession of massage therapy is defined as engaging in applying a scientific system of activity to the muscular structure of the human body by means of stroking, kneading, tapping and vibrating with the hands or vibrators for the purpose of improving muscle tone and circulation.

General Requirements
This page covers the basic requirements and procedures to follow in applying for a license as a massage therapist in New York State. Any use of the title ""massage therapist"" or ""masseuse,"" ""masseur,"" or any derivation of the title, within New York State, requires licensure as a massage therapist.

To be licensed as a massage therapist in New York State you must:

be of good moral character;
be at least 18 years of age;
meet education and examination requirements;
meet experience requirements (if applicable); and
have completed a course in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) within three years prior to licensure.
In addition, an applicant must also submit evidence of English proficiency (if applicable). There is an experience requirement only for massage therapists licensed in another jurisdiction who seek licensure by endorsement.

Submit an application for licensure and the other forms indicated, along with the appropriate fee, to the Office of the Professions at the address specified on each form. It is your responsibility to follow up with anyone you have asked to send us material.

The specific requirements for licensure are contained in Title 8, Article 155, Section 7800 of New York's Education Law and Part 78 of the Commissioner's Regulations.

You should also read the general licensing information applicable for all professions.

Fees
The fee for licensure and first registration is $108.

The fee for a limited permit is $35 (The limited permit fee is not refundable).

Fees are subject to change. The fee due is the one in law when your application is received. If fees are increased by statute retroactively, you will be billed for the difference.

Do not send cash.
Make your personal check or money order payable to the New York State Education Department. Your cancelled check is your receipt.
Mail your application and fee to:
NYS Education Department
Office of the Professions
PO Box 22063
Albany, NY 12201

NOTE: Payment submitted from outside the United States should be made by check or draft on a United States bank and in United States currency; payments submitted in any other form will not be accepted and will be returned.

Partial Refunds
If you withdraw your licensure application you may be entitled to a partial refund.

For the procedure to withdraw your application, contact the Massage Therapy Unit at opunit3@nysed.gov or by calling 518-474-3817, ext. 270 or by fax at 518-402-5354, or by letter.
The State Education Department is not responsible for any fees paid to an outside testing or credentials verification agency.
If you withdraw your application, obtain a refund, and then decide to seek New York State licensure at a later date, you will be considered a new applicant, and you will be required to pay the licensure and registration fees and meet the licensure requirements in place at the time you reapply.

Education Requirement
To meet the professional education requirement for licensure, you must:

Complete high school or its equivalent and graduate from a school or institute of massage therapy with a program registered by the New York State Education Department* as licensure qualifying, or its substantial equivalent in both subject matter or extent of training, provided that the program in such school or institute shall consist of classroom instruction with a total of not less than 1000 hours in specific subjects satisfactory to the Department.
Complete coursework in anatomy, physiology, neurology, myology or kinesiology, pathology, hygiene, first aid, CPR, infection control procedures, the chemical ingredients of products that are used and their effects, as well as the theory, technique and practice of both oriental and western massage/bodywork therapy. Within the 1000 hours of education, you will have had to complete a minimum of 150 hours of practice on a person.
*NOTE: If your program is not listed, contact the State Board for Massage Therapy to determine if it is a New York State licensure qualifying program.

Examination Requirements
To meet the examination requirement for licensure, you must pass the New York State Massage Therapy Examination (see New York State Massage Therapy Examination Blueprint). Before being admitted to the examination, you must have met all requirements for licensure except citizenship.

The examination is offered twice annually, in January and August. You must file a separate examination scheduling application with Scantron Assessment. The examination scheduling application is available through Scantron Assessment at:

Your permit will not be issued until all required documentation has been reviewed and approved by the New York State Education Department. If you are issued a limited permit, you must work under the personal, on-site supervision of an individual licensed and currently registered to practice massage therapy in New York State.

Your limited permit is valid for no more than one year from the date it is issued, or until the results of the first examination for which you are eligible are made known, whichever comes first. You may not be issued a limited permit if you have previously held a permit or have failed the New York State Massage Therapy Examination.

You may not engage in private practice if you hold a limited permit. You must be employed by a licensed massage therapist or by an entity authorized to practice massage therapy that engages a licensed massage therapist to provide personal, on-site supervision.

The fee for a limited permit is $35.

Oklahoma Massage License
Wind turbines in southwest Oklahoma
Updated: 3/26/2020
Oklahoma began regulating the massage therapy profession and started requiring licensure for all massage therapists as of 2016. Massage therapy is regulated by the Oklahoma State Board of Cosmetology and Barbering, and licensed under the Massage Therapy Practice Act. An Advisory Board of Massage Therapy was created to assist the State Board in carrying out its duties including establishing and enforcing standards of competency and professional conduct, as well as reviewing applications and issuing licenses for massage therapists.

To become a licensed massage therapist (LMT) in the state of Oklahoma, you must first complete the requirements as described on the Oklahoma Advisory Board of Massage Therapy website. We’ve provided a summary of these requirements below for a quick reference. Industry research from ABMP in 2016 estimated that there was about 1,150 massage therapists in Oklahoma.

Massage Education Requirements in Oklahoma

If you have not yet taken the Massage and Bodywork Licensing Exam and are planning to seek licensure in Oklahoma, simply select this state when registering for the MBLEx, and they will send your scores to the Oklahoma Advisory Board of Massage Therapy when you pass. Check out our About the MBLEx page to see how to apply and schedule your exam.

Additional License Requirements

Be at least 18 years of age
Have proof of current professional liability insurance
Have a certificate and transcript of completion from a state-licensed massage school with at least 500 hours of education in massage therapy
Complete a criminal history information report from the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation
Application Process
Those who meet the the Oklahoma massage therapy license requirement may download and complete the massage license application. 

Applicants may also apply for licensure by reciprocity. This process is the same as the regular application process, but uses a different application form and requires providing evidence of licensure in another state or territory.

Application fee: $50
License by reciprocity: $65
License renewal fee: $50

How to Become a Massage Therapist in Pennsylvania - OR

In Pennsylvania, massage therapy certification opens up many professional opportunities. Pennsylvania is actively revising a bill at this time that licenses massage therapy professionals within the state that recognizes the importance of the art and science of bodywork and massage therapy. 

Steps to becoming a Massage Therapist in Pennsylvania
After completing the necessary education you will then be able to sit for a national licensing examination that is given by the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage & Bodywork. At this time Pennsylvania law recognizes the NCBTMB examination and does not require a state specific test in order to grant a license within the state.
Finally once you have completed the national certification you can apply for a license within the state of Pennsylvania.  Additional qualifications you must meet by the laws of Pennsylvania include: the applicant is of good moral character, possesses a high school diploma or its equivalent, has paid the fee for licensing, and is not addicted to alcohol, narcotics or other habit forming drugs.
Pennsylvania law also states that an applicant for license and a practicing massage therapist must have a current CPR (cardio-pulmonary resuscitation) certificate. Contact the Pennsylvania chapter of The American Heart Association to find out how to become certified.
Find a job as a massage therapist. Massage therapy is useful in many settings and you could find work in a spa or a chiropractic office. As well you could find a job in a rehabilitation setting.

Massage Therapy Licensure in South Carolina
South Carolina massage therapists are licensed by the Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, in conjunction with the South Carolina Massage/Bodywork Therapy Panel. Individuals are licensed on the basis of massage therapy education and examination. Additionally, candidates must be at least eighteen and in possession of high school diplomas or GEDs.

Licensure and practice is governed by the Massage Therapy Practice Act. The state of South Carolina reserves the right to ask applicants or licensees to submit to drug tests or other physical or mental assessments if there is ‘reasonable grounds’ for the request (scstatehouse.gov /code / t40c030 php).

Education Requirements for Massage Therapists
Prospective massage therapists must study at approved massage/ bodywork schools (scstatehouse.gov / code / t40c030 .php). ‘Approved school’ is defined as meaning that the program meets education and training requirements. The program must include 500 hours of classroom study.

Examination Requirements
South Carolina massage therapists are licensed by examination. The Massage Therapy Practice Act cites three approved examinations: the Massage and Bodywork Licensing Examination (MBLEx), the National Certification Exam for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (NCETMB), and the National Certification Examination for Therapeutic Massage (NCETM). However, only one of these examinations, the MBLEx, is currently available to new massage therapists. South Carolina application materials note that after November 1, 2014, the ‘National Certification Examination’ would not be offered.

The MBLEx is offered by the Federation of State Massage Therapy Boards (FSMTB). There is a $195 fee. Candidates apply directly to the FSMTB; they can expect their applications to be processed in a week’s time. Once approved, the candidate will schedule through Pearson VUE. Examinations are now computer-adapted. They are available on an ongoing basis at sites around the nation. Examinees do need to schedule in advance; the Authorization to Test (ATT) grants a 90 day eligibility window.

The examination covers anatomy and physiology, kinesiology, massage and bodywork overview, benefits, pathology, ethical and legal issues, professional practice standards, and assessment and treatment planning. The FSMTB has made candidate bulletins available in PDF format; candidates can also request printed versions (https://www.fsmtb.org / mblex/). They are expected to read the bulletin before making application.

The Panel provided a fact sheet about the MBLEx soon after its adoption. While the sheet is still accessible from the website, some information is not current. The information was written when only a few states had adopted the MBLEX; now the examination is accepted in more than 40 U.S. jurisdictions (www.fsmtb.org/).

The Massage Therapy Practice Act allows for other examinations to be approved by the Panel.

The Application Process
Individuals apply after meeting all requirements, including examination. Applications materials are available for download from the website of the South Carolina Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation (llr.state.sc.us / /Massage Therapy / index ?file=pub). Prospective massage therapists also have the option of applying online. However, some supplemental materials will be required. The downloadable ‘Online Application Forms’ packet includes printable documents.

There is an affidavit that requires notarization. Online applicants have the option of uploading it or mailing it to the following address:

SC Massage/Bodywork Panel
PO BOX 11329
Columbia, SC 29211

The applicant will need to affix a recent passport-type photograph to one of the supplemental application pages; again, the completed page may be uploaded or mailed.

The ‘affidavit of eligibility’ also requires notarization. The purpose of the document is to establish citizenship or other lawful status. Applicants who are not citizens of the United States will be required to provide copies of immigration documents. Among the accepted documents are permanent resident cards, unexpired refugee travel documents, and I-20 certificates of eligibility (student status). A complete list is found in the application materials.

Massage therapy transcripts can be sent directly from the issuing institution or mailed by the applicant; they must be in their original sealed envelopes.

The FSMTB typically provides electronic verification to one state board selected by the applicant. The application materials, however, direct the individual to include a copy of the qualifying score report.

There is a $50 application fee and $100 licensing fee (llr.state.sc.us / POL / Massage Therapy file).

Application status can be monitored online (eservice.llr.sc.gov / Login Secure Portal).

Out-of-State Massage Therapists
Massage therapists who are licensed in other states can be licensed by reciprocity if the other jurisdiction has requirements that are at least on a par with those of South Carolina. The licensing agency notes that review would be required if the massage therapist had taken a state examination as opposed to an examination that had been approved in South Carolina; the Panel would need to see the examination or examination outline (llr.state.sc.us / POL / MassageTherapy / index.asp file=faq).

A candidate for license by reciprocity must submit a certificate from the Board or Department in the other jurisdiction (llr.state.sc.us / POL / Massage Therapy / file=MASREC). Applicants are asked to also include a copy of the license with the application materials.

Former South Carolina Massage Therapists
Individuals who have held South Carolina licenses but allowed them to expire may be eligible for reinstatement. They will need to complete a continuing education requirement. A reinstatement application form is available on the Department website (llr.state.sc.us / POL / Massage Therapy). There is a $210 fee.

Additional Information
Information on massage therapy licensure is available from the South Carolina Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation (http://www.llr.state.sc.us/POL/MassageTherapy/index.asp). Massage therapists should be aware that there are periodic changes. Text of the Massage Therapy Act and Panel Regulations is available online (llr.state.sc.us / POL / Massage Therapy / index.asp file=laws); there were some revisions to the Act in 2013.

The licensing agency can be reached by telephone at (803) 896-4588 or by email at 'BoardInfo at llr.sc.gov'.

The South Carolina Chapter of the American Massage Therapy Association is the state’s professional organization (www.amta-sc.org). AMTA-SC is not involved with the licensing process, but serves as an additional professional resource.

CONTINUING EDUCATION
Licensed massage therapists must complete at least 8 hours of continuing education every two years.  (SDCL 36-35-19)  Qualifying continuing education is any course with a clear purpose and objective which maintains, improves, or expands the skills and knowledge relevant to massage therapy of the human body. Qualifying continuing education must meet the definition of massage therapy pursuant to § 36-35-1(3) or be education presented by an approved provider of the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork, American Medical Massage Association, or Federation of State Massage Therapy Boards. College courses used to meet continuing education requirements must not replicate courses submitted by the licensee to meet the required licensing coursework. An academic semester credit equals 15 continuing education hours and a quarter credit equals 10 continuing education hours. (ARSD 20:76:03)

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) certification from the American Heart Association, the American Red Cross or another course deemed equivalent by the board is qualifying continuing education for up to four hours in each continuing education cycle. In person attendance of a board meeting is qualifying continuing education for up to two hours in each continuing education cycle. No other qualifying continuing education may be repeated in consecutive continuing education cycles.

Any or all of the required 8 hours of continuing education may be obtained electronically (online or by other electronic means).

In person attendance of a board meeting is qualifying continuing education for up to two hours in each continuing education cycle. (ARSD 20:76:03)

Continuing education requirements must be met every two years.The current continuing education cycle runs from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2020. Continuing education used to meet renewal requirements must be taken during the current continuing education cycle.
Because continuing education is required every two years, continuing education is prorated based on the initial date of your licensure. If you were licensed before October 1, 2018, you must show proof of 8 hours of continuing education to renew your license by September 30, 2020. If you were licensed after October 1, 2018, please refer to the following for the continuing education hours required to renew your license by September 30, 2020:

October 1, 2018 – March 31, 2019   
8 hours of continuing education required

April 1, 2019 – September 30, 2019 
6 hours of continuing education required
October 1, 2019 – March 31, 2020   
4 hours of continuing education required
April 1, 2020 – May 31, 2020 

2 hours of continuing education required

Good afternoon,

You will need to apply through initial application for a Tennessee Massage License. The application processing time is four (4) to six (6) weeks if all required documentation is received. The application fee for a massage therapist license in TN is $280.00. You will need to complete an initial application for licensure and submit all required documents in the instructions of the application. You can print off an application from the link below.

If you have completed a 500 hour program that meets the Tennessee Board?s requirements of completion of a massage, bodywork, and or somatic therapy curriculum of no less than (200 hours Health Sciences, 200 hours Massage, 85 hours Allied Modalities, 10 hours Ethics, 5 hours TN Massage Law) and have passed either the NCBTMB exam or MBLEx exam, you will either need to contact the school or personally visit the school to purchase an official transcript. The transcript can be sent by the applicant to our office as long as it is in an official school sealed envelope or request that your school submit an official transcript to the Tennessee Massage Board Administrative Office.

You will need to contact the testing agency (MBLEx) or (NCBTMB) and have them electronically submit your test scores to the Tennessee Massage Licensure Board.
A criminal background check (OCA # 2680) must be completed as well as a 5 hour Tennessee Law Class.
Verification of licensure from each and every state where any licensure is or has been held. The verification must be submitted directly to the Board?s office from the other state(s).

Once your application has been received, you will receive a deficiency letter by mail that will outline all remaining deficiencies. All required documents must be received in the Board Administrative Office within 65 days of the receipt of your application.

Once all documents are received your file will be reviewed by the Board consultant. Once licensed your first continuing education cycle will be prorated, but all remaining cycles require 24 hours of CE including TN Law and Ethics and only 8 of the 24 can be completed online. All remaining 16 hours must be completed in a live format.

If you have further questions, please contact the Massage Licensure Board, at 615-253-2111. or massage.health@tn.gov.

*Please contact the NCBTMB directly to have your test scores sent to our office.

Breakdown of Hours:

*Many applicants decide to be proactive and request this breakdown of hours letter from their schools at the same time they request their official transcripts to be sent.*

It is not uncommon for an applicant to be asked to have their massage school provide a ?breakdown of hours? in addition to the official transcript. When an applicant receives a letter from our office requiring an ?hours breakdown?, what that means is that upon review of the applicant?s transcript, our office has been unable to determine exactly how many classroom hours the applicant completed in our required subject areas. The applicant should contact his or her massage school and request a signed and dated business letter on school letterhead to be sent directly from the school to our office. This letter should indicate exactly how many classroom hours (not ?credits?) the applicant (not ?all our students?) completed in the following subject areas:

Health Sciences, which can include any coursework covering the study of the human body: Tennessee requires 200 classroom hours.

Massage, theory and/or practice, so clinical hours can be included to meet this requirement: Tennessee requires 200 classroom hours.

Related Subjects or Allied Modalities, which includes any other subjects also a part of the program: Tennessee requires 85 classroom hours.

Ethics, just Ethics, do not include any other course subject in this number: Tennessee requires 10 classroom hours.

For detailed information on what types of classes are commonly classed in these subject areas, please see the link below:

General Rules Governing Licensed Massage Therapists and Establishments in Tennessee:
http://publications.tnsosfiles.com/rules/0870/0870-01.20170817.pdf
*Page 7 covers the educational requirements for licensure.

Please feel free to forward this email to your massage school so that they can have exact written instructions for the breakdown of hours letter.


Letters of Recommendation:

The letters of recommendation do require an original signatures. Emailed or faxed copies can be accepted. These must be original letters; no form letters can be accepted.

The 2 people who write these letters for you must be licensed healthcare professionals. This means they must be actively licensed by a state health department in a healthcare profession, such as doctors, nurses, dentists, pharmacists, professional counselors, and many other licensed healthcare professions. They may be people who know you well professionally or personally, and are willing to say nice things about your morals and ethics in a letter.

Whoever writes these letters, please make sure they include on the letter their contact information (address and phone number, business information is fine) in the form of professional letterhead at the top of the letter, the date (the letters must not be more than 12 months old), their original signature, and their licensing credentials. For an example of licensing credentials: If a Tennessee LMT was writing a letter for you, they would put ?TN LMT (their license number)?.

Please contact your massage school(s) directly to have official transcripts sent, and the boards you are licensed by to have written verification of your licensure sent directly to our office. A verification of licensure must include the license number, date licensed, status of the license, and whether there has been any discipline on the license.


I recommend getting as much as possible of the requirements completed before turning in your application. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns.

Thank you,

Hi.

My California Massage Therapy Certification number is 18843 with the CAMTC or CA Massage Therapy Council. It expires 4/14/2021 under Janis Corona in Riverside, CA as a licensed and certified massage therapist. 

My school that closed is Alta College in Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach CA.

Thank you,

Good afternoon.

I have been a licensed massage therapist in California since 2011, and a massage therapist graduate of 500 hours of education since 2006. I have tried to get my transcripts and the school is closed, and the bureau of private and post education has them listed as closed since 2016. I never took a national certification, but contacted MBLEX, and they said I would need proof I tried contacting my school and the BPPE mentioned above to show the school closed and I can't provide my transcripts. I have the certificate with seal and my own transcripts I saved since my graduation that I kept with my personal documents such as birth certificate and degrees and diplomas from high school, undergrad, and graduate school in data science. 

What path can I take to license for massage therapist in Tennessee? My niece wants to go to school out there and I wouldn't mind moving there. The pay is similar as in Corona CA and the cost of living with less traffic.

Thank you so much.

Utah Massage License
Bryce Canyon Utah
Updated: 3/26/2020
Massage therapists in Utah must have a massage license before beginning to practice in this state. Licenses are issued by the Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing (DOPL), which is in the Department of Commerce.

To become a licensed massage therapist (LMT) in the state of Utah, applicants must first complete the requirements as described on the DOPL website. Massage therapists may acquire licensure through the standard massage education process, or through an apprenticeship program. Therapists must also pass a recognized examination such as the Massage and Bodywork Licensing Exam (MBLEx) offered by the FSMTB. We’ve provided a summary of these requirements below for a quick reference. Industry research from ABMP in 2016 estimated that there was nearly 6,000 massage therapists in Utah.

Licensing Process
Become a Massage Therapist
Massage Therapy School
Massage Therapist Requirements in Vermont
As of 2015, Vermont does not license massage therapists, though there are groups in the state working toward greater regulation.

The trend nationwide is not only toward increasing regulation but toward higher standards. Vermont massage therapists can position themselves by pursuing education on a par with national standards and later seeking voluntary third party certifications.

Select a Vermont Massage Therapist Topic:
Massage Therapy Schools in Vermont

Third Party Certifications
Staying Current on Legislative Developments
Educational Foundations
In order to meet industry standards, a program must include at least 500 hours of education. It must also operate legitimately within its jurisdiction. In some regulated states, programs must be approved by the licensing agency. Other programs draw their authority from state licensing and/ or regional or national accreditation. The Commission on Massage Therapy Education (COMTA) is an accrediting agency specifically designed for massage therapy; it is one of many accreditations recognized by the U.S. Department of Education.

Programs may also enjoy approvals or institutional memberships. These are not accreditations, but show that a program is legitimate and has a curriculum appropriate to the profession.

Prospective massage therapists may seek their education through schools that have been assigned codes by the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (NCBTMB); Vermont currently has five assigned schools (ncbtmb.org / find approved school / state=VT).

Schools that have been assigned NCBTMB codes include at least 500 hours of massage therapy education and meet the following minimum curriculum standards:

There are 125 hours of body systems coursework; this includes kinesiology, physiology, and anatomy.
At least 200 hours are devoted to massage and bodywork theory, application, and assessment. The NCBTMB requires that instruction in this content area take place in class and be hands-on.
Pathology comprises 40 hours.
There are at least ten hours of combines business and ethics coursework; at least six of these are in ethics.
It can be advantageous to enroll in a program that includes more than the minimum 500 hours. It may enhance mobility as some states (for example, neighboring New Hampshire) set educational requirements higher.

Professional Memberships
A new massage therapist may seek membership in a professional organization and later professional certification. Some states consider professional membership when licensing professionals during the initial “grandfathering” period.

Professional organizations maintain high standards for members. Both the American Massage Therapy Association (AMTA) and Associated Massage and Bodywork Professionals (AMBP) are established and respected within the industry.

AMTA: The American Massage Therapy Association (AMTA) not only requires members to subscribe to a code of ethics but requires them to have 500 hours of education (amtamassage.org / membership / join membership package chapter membership select). An individual enrolled in a 500 hour program can become a student member and later a graduate member.

AMBP: American Bodywork and Massage Professionals (ABMP) requires members at the professional level to have either 500 hours of education or passing scores on the MBLEx (abmp.com / practitioners / membership options and costs). Individuals who are already licensed as nurses or physical therapists are an exception.

The MBLEx is offered by the Federation of State Massage Therapy Boards (fsmtb.org/). It is the examination that is used for licensing purposes in most U.S. states. The MBLEx tests a range of concepts from anatomy and physiology to massage practice and professional ethics. In order to register for the MBLEx, an individual must confirm that he or she has had education appropriate to the massage therapy profession. There is a $195 examination fee.

Both AMTA and AMMA provide members with professional liability insurance. Membership prices vary, depending on career stage.

Third Party Certifications
A graduate of an assigned school can eventually seek board certification through the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork; some individuals may also be approved to test through a portfolio process.

Board certification is a relatively new credential with standards set higher than they were for previous NCBTMB certifications (ncbtmb.com / board certification). The requirements are also set higher than what is required for licensing in many states; the credential was designed for an era where practitioners in most jurisdictions hold licensing but where some want to distinguish themselves from their peers who have met only state mandates.

A board certified massage therapist will ultimately need 750 hours of education, though the education does not all have to be completed as part of the original program. Additional hours may be earned through a college or university or through continuing education that has been approved by the NCBTMB.

Prospective certificate holders must pass the Board Certification Examination for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (BCETMB). The BCETMB requires candidates to apply their knowledge to scenarios that they might encounter in the professional world. The exam covers the following topics or themes:

Technique and application
Evaluation, treatment planning, and documentation
Law and ethics
Communication
Board certified massage therapists subscribe to a code of ethics. They agree to oppose human trafficking. They also go through a background check process. A massage therapist must practice at the professional level for a minimum six months before certification can be awarded; he or she must accrue 250 experience hours.

The initial board certification process costs $250. Fees must be paid before examination.

American Bodywork and Massage Professionals offers a more basic credential. In order to maintain the highest level of ABMP membership – and wear the title “ABMP Certified Massage Therapist” – a massage professional must complete an annual continuing education requirement (abmp.com / practitioners / faqs). Education/ examination requirements are the same as they are at the professional level: 500 hours of education or a passing score on the MBLEx.

Staying Current on Legislative Developments
There are groups working toward registering or licensing the state’s massage therapists. Professional organizations can help members stay current on developments. The American Massage Therapy Association posts legislative updates on a monthly basis (amtamassage.org / government / leg briefing).

Vermont has its own chapter: AMT-Vermont (amta-vermont.org/wp/).

In 2015 the Vermont Chapter of the AMTA and the ABMP filed with The Vermont Secretary of State Office of Professional Regulation and Application for Preliminary Sunrise Assessment: Massage Therapy (2015/16). The study determined that creating a state level administrative licensing regulation is unnecessary and would not offer any further protection for the public or practitioners.

There may still be city or county rules and regulations regarding the practice of massage therapy or creating a massage establishment. So massage therapists in Vermont should check with local regulatory agencies before starting to practice. Industry research from ABMP in 2016 estimated that there was about 920 massage therapists in Vermont.

Temporary Licensure
This provision applies only to those eligible for licensure by examination and who meet all other requirements for licensure, but who have not
yet received scores from an approved nationally administered entry-level competency assessment examination.
A temporary license expires 6 months after the date of issuance or when the Department receives notice that the temporary licensee has failed or
passed the examination required by Wis. Stat. § 460.06, whichever is first.
a. A temporary license may not be renewed; and
b. No person shall be issued more than one temporary license.
Practice under a temporary license shall be under the supervision of a licensed Massage Therapist or Bodywork Therapist, at the level of general,
direct, or direct one-on-one supervision as necessary to avoid unacceptable risk of harm to the client. The supervising Massage Therapist or
Bodywork Therapist is responsible for determining the level of supervision necessary to avoid unacceptable risk of harm to the client and is
responsible for the acts of the temporary licensee.
The supervisor may be subject to discipline for failure to appropriately supervise the temporary licensee and/or for failure to ensure that, the
temporary licensee adheres to the Board’s rules and the standards of minimal competence.
The supervisor responsible for the temporary licensee shall ensure that clients know the temporary licensee is not fully licensed and that the
supervisor is ultimately responsible for the care provided. It is recommended that this information be documented in the client record.
Licensure by Reciprocity: An applicant is eligible for reciprocal licensure as a Massage Therapist or Bodywork Therapist if the applicant:

2. Holds a current similar license, registration or certificate to practice Massage Therapy or Bodywork Therapy in another U.S. state or
territory or another country, the requirements for which are substantially equivalent to the requirements under Wis. Stat. § 460.05.
“Substantially Equivalent” means the requirements must include either of the following:
• Certification by the NCBTMB or any other organization accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies to
certify Massage Therapy or Bodywork Therapy; or
• Completion of at least 600 classroom hours of instruction in Massage Therapy or Bodywork Therapy at a school approved by

the jurisdiction from which the applicant wishes to reciprocate.

country. You are required to have each jurisdiction in which you have ever been credentialed submit letters of verification to DSPS.
The letters must indicate your date of birth, credential number, date of issuance, and a statement regarding disciplinary actions. City or
county certification/licensure does not meet the State licensure requirement, nor will you need to submit verification from these
jurisdictions.
5. Passes the Wisconsin State Law Examination: The Wisconsin Massage Therapy and Bodywork Therapy State Law Exam is an
online open book examination on the Wisconsin Statutes and Administrative Codes that govern Massage Therapists and Bodywork
Therapists. Candidates will be assigned an ID#, test name, and password after applying.

Student clinic: 20 hours
CPR and first aid: 5 hours
In some cases, the five hours of CPR may be pursued through alternate means.

The student will need six hours of education in Wisconsin massage law and rules; this may or may not be a part of the original massage therapy program (docs.legis.wisconsin.gov / code / mtbt pdf).

Alternate Educational Pathway: NCBTMB Certification
An individual who holds certification through the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork or other certification agency accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies is considered to have met educational requirements with the exception of CPR/ first aid.

The NCBTMB currently offers Board Certification (ncbtmb.org / board certification). Some requirements are set higher than they are for Wisconsin licensure; board certified massage therapists must have fully 750 hours of education, or the equivalent. They must pass a board certification examination.

a
Some massage therapists hold 'national certification' through the NCBTMB. This certification type will not be officially retired until the end of 2016, though some certificate holders have earlier expiration dates (ncbtmb.org / board certification transition). Massage therapists who are unsure of their expiration date may contact the NCBTMB by telephone at 800-296-0664 or by email at 'info at ncbtmb.org'.

Examination Requirements
Wisconsin massage therapists take two examinations: a national massage therapy examination and a state test of laws and rules (dsps.wi.gov / exam).

National Examination: The national examination must test entry level competency. Several examinations have been approved. However, some have been discontinued by the administrating organization.

Approved examinations include the following:

National Certification Examination for Therapeutic Massage (NCETM)
National Certification Examination for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (NCETMB)
Asian Bodywork Therapy Exam (ABT)
Massage and Bodywork Licensing Examination (MBLEx)
The ABT was formerly offered by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (nccaom.org).

The NCETM and NCETMB were recently discontinued by the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (ncbtmb.com/).

The Massage and Bodywork Licensing Examination (MBLEx) is offered by the Federation of State Massage Therapy Boards. It is the only one of the approved examinations that is currently available. It is a multiple choice assessment. Massage therapy students and graduates can be approved to test. There is a $195 fee. Candidate handbooks are available for download from the FSMTB website (fsmtb.org/mblex/) . The applicant must affirm having read the content outline. Testing approval can generally be granted within one week. The candidate will receive an ATT that authorizes scheduling through Pearson VUE.

A massage therapist may be granted a temporary license before he or she has taken the national examination. Supervision will be required.

Jurisprudence Examination: The test of laws and rules is open book and online, but candidates must be authorized to take it. Students at Wisconsin massage therapy schools will have the opportunity to take the state test before graduation. The school will provide the ID and password. Other individuals will receive ID and password after they have submitted applications. The test may be taken on a PC computer. A candidate must score 85% to pass. In order to receive credit for passing the exam, he or she must print the feedback form. An individual who does not pass will need to submit a retake application along with a $75 fee.

Insurance Requirement
The prospective massage therapist must take out a malpractice insurance policy that covers at least 1,000,000 per occurrence and year.

The Application Process
Application forms can be downloaded from the website of the Department of Safety and Professional Services (dsps.wi.gov / Page=1fde).

The applicant will need to include a copy of his or her malpractice policy; the document is to include an expiration date.

The application package includes an affidavit that must be notarized.

Candidates for license by examination pay $150 with their applications ($75 for the state law exam and $75 for credentialing).

The temporary license, if required, costs an additional $10. An individual seeking temporary licensure will need to submit an additional form; it requires supervisor signature.

Applicants can expect notification of status. The licensing agency will use email, provided that the applicant has supplied an email address.

License by Reciprocity
A massage therapist who holds licensing, certification, or registration in another U.S. state or territory or in a foreign nation can be licensed by reciprocity provided that the other jurisdiction has requirements that are at least substantially equivalent. The requirements can be considered substantially equivalent if the jurisdiction either 1) requires certification by the NCBTMB or other certifying agency accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies or 2) requires 600 hours of instruction through a school that holds the approval of an accrediting agency (dsps.wi.gov / Forms / Health Application pdf). It will be necessary to provide a copy of the massage therapy rules and regulations. The licensing agency notes that local (city or county) licenses do not qualify a massage therapist for reciprocity.

The licensing agency will require license verification from each jurisdiction where a credential has ever been held.

Reciprocity candidates must take the state jurisprudence examination. They must show evidence that they carry malpractice liability insurance and hold CPR/ AED certification through an approved provider. The Department has provided a link to approved CPR/ AED providers (dhs.wisconsin.gov / ems / licensing / cpr).

Candidates for license by reciprocity pay $157 ($75 for the state law exam and $82 for credentialing).

Additional Information
The Wisconsin Massage Therapy and Bodywork Affiliated Credentialing Board (dsps.wi.gov / Page=3ebd571e) is under the banner of the Department of Safety and Professional Services. The Department can be reached by telephone at (608) 266-2112 or by email at ‘web at dsps.wi.gov’.

The Wisconsin Chapter of the American Massage Therapy Association is the state’s professional organization (amtawi.org). AMTA-Wisconsin does not issue licenses but has provided a list of frequently asked questions about the credentialing process (amtawi.org/faq).

Massage Therapy Licensure in Wyoming
Laramie County has long licensed massage therapists. In much of Wyoming, however, massage therapy remains an unlicensed profession. What can prospective Wyoming massage therapists do to establish legitimacy, besides determine whether their own cities or counties have regulations in place?

The American Massage Therapy Association notes four types of credentials that a massage therapist may possess (amtamassage.org / find a massage / credential). Three of the four may be attained by practitioners in unlicensed states. They can pursue education through accredited schools, become members of professional organizations, and ultimately seek board certification.

Massage Therapist Education Foundations
While some massage therapists are trained as apprentices, massage therapy education is the typical foundation. Most states require 500 to 600 hours of qualifying education, though some set the standard as high as 1,000 (massagetherapy.com / careers / MTreg pdf). National organizations, too, tend to set 500 hours as the minimum. WY [R] SF 86, which in early 2015 failed to make it out of committee, would have required new practitioners to either demonstrate 500 hours of education or pass an examination (cqstatetrack.com / texis / state track in session). It remains to be seen what provisions will be in place at such time as Wyoming passes a licensing bill.

Wyoming does not have a state licensing agency that approves massage therapy programs. However, there are still organizations that provide oversight. Some Wyoming programs are accredited through accrediting agencies recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. Some enjoy approval by, or institutional membership through, massage therapy organizations. Wyoming has two massage therapy programs that are members of the American Massage Therapy Association, or AMTA (amtamassage.org / schools). It has one program that has been assigned a code by the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork, or NCBTMB. Both AMTA members and NCBTMB-assigned schools include at least 500 hours of instruction. NCBTMB schools must meet published curriculum standards (ncbtmb.com / assigned schools). They include at least 200 hours of hands-on instruction in an in-person setting.

Professional Memberships and Certifications
Professional association membership can confer some legitimacy to practice. Both AMTA and Associated Bodywork and Massage Professionals (ABMP) have educational standards in place for members. To be an ABMP member at the professional level, an individual must either complete 500 hours of massage therapy education, or pass the MBLEx, a national licensing examination (abmp.com / practitioners / membership options and costs). To become a graduate member of AMTA, one must have graduated (or be approaching graduation) from a 500 hour program; student members must be enrolled in one (amtamassage.org / membership / join membership package)

Professional association membership can also provide liability insurance: one of the requirements for eventual board certification.

The National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork is the standard for voluntary credentialing. In an age where most U.S. states do require licensing, the NCBTMB has upped certification standards to where NCBTMB credentialing represents, in many cases, a higher standard. The NCBTMB requires fully 750 hours (or the equivalent) for its new board certification (ncbtmb.com / board certification). Up to 250 hours of qualifying education may be taken after the qualifying certificate program. However, if the school does not have an NCBTMB code, the candidate cannot establish eligibility through the traditional educational pathway. He or she may eventually be eligible through portfolio review.

Certification candidate takes an examination known as the Board Certification Examination for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork, or BCETMB (ncbtmb.org / take board certification exam). Candidates are eligible to sit for the exam as soon as they have graduated. Once approved, they can schedule through Pearson VUE.

Board certification candidates agree to uphold NCBTMB practice standards and code of ethics and to oppose human trafficking. Additional requirements include going through a background check process and earning CPR certification through the American Heart Association, American Red Cross, or American Safety and Health Institute.

A massage therapist must accrue at least 250 hours of experience before board certification is awarded. According to the newest version of the candidate handbook, a candidate has up to two years to fulfill the work experience and educational requirements.

The board certification process costs $250. Candidates who need to go through the portfolio review process incur additional fees. A link to a candidate handbook is found on the ""tools for board certification"" section of the website (ncbtmb.com / board certification).

A massage therapist in an unregulated jurisdiction who does not yet qualify for board certification may want to wear the ABMP Certified Massage Therapist title; in addition to meeting educational requirements at the professional level, an AMBP member at the ""certified"" level must do 16 hours of continuing education during each two year period. Prospective massage therapists should be aware, though, that ABMP is nationally recognized as a professional organization not a certifying agency. AMBP certification does not carry the same weight as NCBTMB certification.

Staying Current
By visiting the website of the American Massage Therapy Association, a prospective massage practitioner can stay current on legislation that may, in the future, impact practice (amtamassage.org / government / leg briefing).

Wyoming has its own state chapter, AMTA-Wyoming (amtawyomingchapter.org). The AMTA-Wyoming website includes contact information for organizational leaders (amtawyomingchapter.org/).
